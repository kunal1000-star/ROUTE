# Current Task Status Assessment

## Previous Task: Console Error Unauthorized Resolution
**Status: ✅ COMPLETED AND VERIFIED**

### What was accomplished:
- Identified root cause: Mixed authentication systems (Supabase vs NextAuth.js)
- Fixed admin API route to use Supabase authentication 
- Standardized authentication across the application
- Verified the fix is working correctly

### Current Application State:
- ✅ Development server running on localhost:3000
- ✅ Main application responding (HTTP 200)
- ✅ Admin APIs working with proper Supabase authentication
- ✅ Authentication system consistent across app
- ✅ No unauthorized console errors

## Next Steps Needed:

### Option 1: New Task Required
- User needs to specify what new task they want me to work on
- Could be bug fixes, feature development, optimizations, etc.

### Option 2: Additional Verification
- Could perform more comprehensive testing
- Could test additional endpoints
- Could verify all features are working correctly

### Option 3: Task Completion Documentation
- The unauthorized error resolution appears complete
- Could create final documentation/report
- Could mark the task as fully finished

## Action Required:
**Need user input on what to work on next**
