# Duplicate Files Cleanup - Task Plan

## Analysis Phase
- [ ] Scan entire project structure for duplicate files
- [ ] Identify exact duplicates (same content)
- [ ] Find similar files (overlapping functionality)
- [ ] Classify files by type and purpose
- [ ] Assess which versions are most current/accurate

## Classification Phase
- [ ] Group similar report/completion files
- [ ] Group similar migration files
- [ ] Group similar test scripts
- [ ] Group similar configuration files
- [ ] Group similar documentation files

## Cleanup Strategy
- [ ] Create backup/duplicates directory
- [ ] Archive older versions instead of deleting
- [ ] Keep most recent/accurate versions
- [ ] Merge complementary content
- [ ] Remove truly obsolete files

## Execution Phase
- [ ] Process report/documentation files
- [ ] Process migration files
- [ ] Process test scripts
- [ ] Process configuration files
- [ ] Update file references and imports
- [ ] Verify application functionality

## Organization Phase
- [ ] Create logical folder structure
- [ ] Move files to appropriate directories
- [ ] Standardize naming conventions
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Create cleanup summary report

## Verification Phase
- [ ] Test application functionality
- [ ] Verify no broken imports
- [ ] Check that all features still work
- [ ] Final project structure validation
