# New Internal Server Error Investigation

## Steps to Diagnose:
- [ ] Check current development server status
- [ ] Test the previously fixed endpoints
- [ ] Examine recent error logs
- [ ] Identify the new error source
- [ ] Test other API endpoints
- [ ] Check for any new dependencies or changes
- [ ] Implement fix for the new issue
- [ ] Verify the fix works

## Current Context:
- Previous internal server error was fixed (AI service manager)
- New internal server error has occurred
- Need to identify the specific new issue
- Focus on finding what changed or what additional routes are failing
